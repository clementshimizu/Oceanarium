before there was light
before there was dark
a single being caught sight
of an eternity to embark
neither female nor male
we call them spirit whale
they were utterly alone
but did not want a clone
for they would surely merge
and thus resisted the urge
an eternity passed like this
in the lonely abyss
spirit whale finally cried
it is time that i died!
ultimate sacrifice
into four they were sliced
born natural experiments
in the four sacred elements
